I've been coding in React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, Express, Fastify, MongoDB, MySQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind, C, C++, C#, Rust, Haskell, Perl, PHP, Assembly, Logo and YouDontKnowShit programming language etc to name a few. Although I barely know the syntax (Psst, Stack overflow!), I consider myself a Ninja developer I'm laughing right now.`,
